## Part 1: Introduction to virtualization concepts

- Virtualization

Virtualization is a process that allows for more efficient use of physical computer hardware and is the foundation of cloud computing.

- Hypervisor

A hypervisor is the software layer that coordinates VMs. It serves as an interface between the VM and the underlying physical hardware, ensuring that each has access to the physical resources it needs to execute. It also ensures that the VMs don’t interfere with each other by impinging on each other’s memory space or compute cycles.

- Virtual machines (VM)

Virtual machines are virtual environments that simulate a physical computer in software form. They normally comprise several files containing the VM’s configuration, the storage for the virtual hard drive, and some snapshots of the VM that preserve its state at a particular point in time.

- Containers

Containers are executable units of software that package application code along with its libraries and dependencies. They allow code to run in any computing environment, whether it be desktop, traditional IT or cloud infrastructure.
